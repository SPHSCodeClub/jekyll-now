Hey all.

So apparently Mother Nature wanted you guys to have some more time to work on the Roll-A-Ball tutorial, so make use of that if you procrastinated it!
We will be meeting not this Wednesday, but Wednesday 01/31/18 in Mrs. York's room. In the meantime, check out [some other tutorials Unity offers](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials).

See you soon!
