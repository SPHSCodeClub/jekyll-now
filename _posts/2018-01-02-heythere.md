title: Reminder: First meeting tomorrow, January 3rd!
---
Hey there. Just wanted to remind everyone that our first meeting is tomorrow after school in Mrs. York's room.

If you have a laptop, feel free to bring it. Go ahead and download the free version of [Unity](https://store.unity.com/).
We're gonna learn how to make some video games! I can't wait to get started.
If you haven't already, follow the [twitter](https://twitter.com/sphscodeclub), and join the [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/sphscodeclub/shared_invite/enQtMjgzMDE1Mzc3MjY4LTY5ODdmZDJhODdhNzEzNTg1ODk2NDQ4YTNmMzY4YzhhNWExMjk1NjUxY2RkNGM1MWMwZDllZWQ3NjRjNGJlNWI)!
