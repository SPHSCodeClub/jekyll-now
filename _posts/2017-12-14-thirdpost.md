Hey everyone. Just wanted to give you an update as to what is happening with the club.
For the past two years, Code Club has indeed existed, but activity has sort of fizzled out over the course of the year.

This year, I plan to meet every two weeks to work on fun projects (I'm drafting the first one right now!) and I can't wait to get started.
Everyone is very busy with college apps right now, so the first meeting will be held on January 3rd, after Winter break. 
For those who don't have any CS Experience; play some [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/)!
If you haven't already, follow the [twitter](https://twitter.com/sphscodeclub), and join the [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/sphscodeclub/shared_invite/enQtMjgzMDE1Mzc3MjY4LTY5ODdmZDJhODdhNzEzNTg1ODk2NDQ4YTNmMzY4YzhhNWExMjk1NjUxY2RkNGM1MWMwZDllZWQ3NjRjNGJlNWI)!
