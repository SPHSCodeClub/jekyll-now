title: Some pretty awesome resources
---
So today we were introduced to Unity, which is a game engine. While it's really cool, it is quite niche in the sense
that it is specifically for Game Design and you must use C# or JavaScript.

Here are some great resources to get you started with programming:
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), a site that has some awesome beginner coding tutorials in a bunch of languages. Great place to start.
[Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/), a free-to-play and engaging game that teaches you the basics of comp sci in a variety of languages.
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming), everyone knows it, and they offer some helpful lessons to get you going.
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a website for help with code issues and questions.
[r/learnprogramming on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), a forum for beginners.

Good luck everyone, and message me on [Slack](https://sphscodeclub.slack.com/) if you have any other questions. Welcome to the wonderful world of Computer Science.
